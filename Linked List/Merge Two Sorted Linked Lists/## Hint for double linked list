"""
Normally it is little bit difficult to do these merge, but if we have double linked list, we can easily do it by

x        =    1 -> 4 -> 6
y        =    2 -> 3 -> 5

Now attach both the lists into single one
new_list    =    1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5

Now keep a pointer(i) at 6(end of 1st list) and other pointer(j) at 5(end of 2nd list) in new_list
Keep comparing those elements, if i.data > j.data ===>   swap(i.data, j.data), j = j.prev
                               else               ===>   i = i.prev
